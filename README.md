# Netflix Clone with GPT-3.5 Integration

This project is a Netflix clone that fetches TV shows and movies from The TMDB API. It utilizes Firebase for authentication, storing user names and passwords, and uses React Router DOM for routing. The app features React Icons and React-Select for enhanced UI/UX. 

## Features

- **Movie and TV Show Cards**: Users can view cards of movies and TV shows, similar to Netflix. Clicking on a card shows detailed information about the selected movie or TV show, along with its trailer or teaser directly from YouTube.
  
- **Account Section**: Users can view their account details.
  
- **Multiple Movie Categories**: Just like Netflix, the app features different sliders for various categories such as popular movies, top-rated movies, upcoming movies, and more. The same categorization applies to TV shows.
  
- **GPT-3.5 Integration**: The app integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API, allowing users to ask for movie recommendations directly within the app.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and functional on various devices.
  
- **Language Selection**: On the GPT Search Page, users can select their preferred language.
